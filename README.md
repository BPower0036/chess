**How this works**

When you click a link, it opens a GitHub Issue with the required pre-populated text. Just push "Create New Issue". That will trigger a [GitHub Actions](https://github.blog/2020-07-03-github-action-hero-casey-lee/#getting-started-with-github-actions) workflow that'll update my GitHub Profile _README.md_ with the new state of the board. Furthermore, you can't go twice in a row. 

**Notice a problem?**

Raise an [issue](https://github.com/BPower0036/chess/issues), and include the text _cc @timburgan_.
